# Universal AI Sync for Halo Custom Edition
UAIS is a project to force IA synchronization on Halo Custom Edition servers, this repository is a
restoration from the left code by IceCrow14, he left modding community a while ago, so all what
he was working on was erased, but he sent us his last version of the UAIS project and I managed to
port it to a bundable [Mercury](https://github.com/Sledmine/Mercury) project.

**NOTE:** There are no plans to continue working on his code as there is a new project made from
zero, with better structure and better performance, check out
[Mimic](https://github.com/Sledmine/Mimic) for more information.
